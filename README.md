The following program is designed to provide a precise, accurate, and inescapable glimpse of your near future in the form of vague and generic statement about an aspect of your life that probably isn't remotely relevant to your current concerns.

DISCLAIMER:
- TRIGGER WARNINGS: Discrimination; Astrology; Jordan Peterson
- This tool pertains to a spiritual and immaterial approach to life, as such, the validity of its output is heavily conditioned by the genuineness and the faith of the user: any prediction generated insincerely, whether as an act of malice aiming to discredit the process, or out of unwillingness to embrace the inescapability of fate is bound to render the prediction null and void of any value or correctness
- NONE OF THIS CONSTITUTES LEGAL ADVICE
- NONE OF THIS CONSTITUTES FINANCIAL ADVICE
- As the code randomizes the relation between the input and the output, this program isn't discriminatory by any mean, unlike the fact of fueling prejudice on the basis of a person's position of birth in time, which is obviously as foul a behaviour as exercising discrimination on the basis of one's position of birth in any of the other three space-time dimensions
